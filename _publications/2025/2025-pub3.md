  Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time. We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7 different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at 0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by 0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar speeds.

With their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in various applications, we provide a comprehensive survey of VLMs. Specifically, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects:
