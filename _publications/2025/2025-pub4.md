  3D vision has rapidly evolved with increasingly diverse data modalities, learning paradigms, and modeling strategies. However, the field remains fragmented across representations and benchmarks, making it difficult to establish unified perspectives on efficiency, fidelity, and scalability. This work provides a data-centric taxonomy of 3D vision, connecting geometric representations, datasets, and learning frameworks within a single conceptual map. We analyze structural trade-offs among major data forms, including point clouds, meshes, voxels, implicit fields, and 3D Gaussians, and discuss how benchmark design and supervision regimes shape recent advances such as 2D-supervised 3D learning, implicit neural representations, and 4D world modeling. Through this integrative perspective, we clarify the relationships between representations and downstream applications in reconstruction, generation, and video modeling, offering a consolidated view of emerging trends toward efficiency-fidelity balance and multimodal geometric grounding.

With their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in various applications, we provide a comprehensive survey of VLMs. Specifically, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects:
