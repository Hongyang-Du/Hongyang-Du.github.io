    Hi, I’m <strong>Hongyang Du (杜泓洋)</strong> — an incoming Sc.M. Computer Science student at 
    <strong>Brown University</strong>, with a strong foundation in 
    <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>multimodal systems</strong>. 
    I recently completed my undergraduate studies in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Mathematics</strong> 
    at the <strong>University of Maryland</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic interests include <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, 
    and solving the occasional quirky math problem. 
    Outside of research, I’m a passionate <strong>powerlifter</strong> and a <strong>professional drummer</strong>, 
    with a love for both <em>jazz fusion</em> and <em>progressive metal</em> — 
    think <em>Chick Corea's Elektric Band</em> meets <em>Animals as Leaders</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, I live with a cat named <strong>Dingzhen</strong>, who keeps me grounded.
  </p>
