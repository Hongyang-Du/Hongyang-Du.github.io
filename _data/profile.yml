    Hi, I am <strong><code>Hongyang Du</code></strong> ‚Äî an incoming Sc.M. Computer Science student at 
    <strong><code>Brown University</code></strong>. I recently completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics 
    at the <strong<code>University of Maryland, College Park</code></strong>. My academic interests include <strong><code>Machine Learning</code></strong>, <strong><code>Computer Vision</code></strong>, 
    and random quirky math problem. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of research, I am an amateur powerlifter and a pro drummer, 
    I am a bipolar Jazz cat and prog metalhead ‚Äî think <em>Chick Corea</em> meets <em>Animals as Leaders</em>. Also, I live with a cat named <strong><code>Dingzhen (‰∏ÅÁúü)</code></strong>, who keeps me grounded.
